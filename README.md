== PodLoko

This is an small proof-of-concept application I made in 2009-2010 for WillowTree Apps,
which let people visit a page and control the playlist on an
iPhone sitting somewhere on wifi (with a tiny Pusher-based iOS app). We
used this to power the office stereo for a while.

The concept is similar to the startup Rockbot, and this app / code has been
long neglected in favor of more interesting projects.

Nothing to see here.
